# Prime-Checker-and-Generator
This Python program provides functionality to check whether a number is prime and to generate a list of prime numbers up to a given limit.
Features-

Prime Checker: Input a number and check if it is a prime number.
Prime Number Generator: Generate all prime numbers up to a specified limit.

How It Works-

The program defines a function is_prime(n) to check if a number n is prime by testing divisibility up to n-1.
The prime_generator(limit) function generates prime numbers from 2 to limit using is_prime().
Every input is user-based.
